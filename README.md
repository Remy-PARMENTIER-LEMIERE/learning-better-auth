There is a projet that was made to learn Better Auth.

# Better Authy

The project was made following the tutorial : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4meIif7Jtc

The prupose was to learn Better Auth, discovering a few other tools as nodemailer, tailwind, shadcn and zod.

For history, I've started to learn Nextjs and Prisma barely a month ago ! It might not be perfect, I've tried different ways of doing things but things are working great !
